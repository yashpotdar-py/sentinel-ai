## **Draft Summary for Documentation**
---

### **Phase 1: Planning & Research**
The Planning & Research phase laid the groundwork for the development of the **Deepfake Detection Hub**, an open-source platform designed to detect manipulated media across images, videos, and audio. This phase focused on finalizing the platform’s core requirements, researching appropriate technologies, and defining the target audience.

---

#### **Step 1: Finalizing Requirements**
- The platform supports three media types: images, videos, and audio.
- Detection capabilities include:
  - **Confidence Scores**: Numerical indicators of manipulation likelihood.
  - **Artifact Insights**: Heatmaps and annotations explaining anomalies.
- The user flow emphasizes simplicity:
  - Drag-and-drop or URL input for uploads.
  - Clear results with confidence scores and visual feedback.

---

#### **Step 2: Research and Identify Technologies**
The technological foundation was established using state-of-the-art models, datasets, and frameworks:
- **Detection Models**:
  - MesoNet for image manipulation.
  - XceptionNet with LSTM for video sequential analysis.
  - Wave-U-Net for synthetic audio detection.
- **Frameworks**:
  - PyTorch/TensorFlow for model development.
  - OpenCV, Librosa for preprocessing.
  - Grad-CAM and Chart.js for visualization.
- **Deployment Plan**:
  - Frontend with Next.js.
  - Backend with FastAPI.
  - MongoDB for storage, Vercel/AWS for hosting.

#### **Step 3: Define User Personas and Use Cases**
Three primary user personas and key use cases were identified:
1. **General Users**:
   - Use Case: Verifying media authenticity shared on social media.
2. **Content Creators**:
   - Use Case: Ensuring integrity of professional media before sharing.
3. **Researchers/Educators**:
   - Use Case: Demonstrating deepfake detection for educational purposes.

---

### **Outcomes of Phase 1**
1. **Feature Documentation**: A clear definition of detection capabilities and user flow.
2. **Technology Selection**: Identified open-source models, datasets, and tools.
3. **User-Centric Design**: Personas and use cases tailored to the platform’s functionality.
